        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">voldt aims to create meaningful and sustainable designs that will live with you no matter where you are.</p>

        <br/>
        <p>Every day, you make design decisions. Sometimes, they might seem small or mundane – like deciding on a pair of sneakers from your collection. Others are large and bold – like investing in an energy-efficient home. No matter the scale of these choices, design plays a crucial role in shaping your daily experience and the world around you.</p>

        <p>As two licensed architects turned computational designers, we are passionate about meaningful design. Voldt owners Will Wang and Austin Mitchell met while studying at the Taubman School of Architecture in Ann Arbor. They saw the potential for data-driven design and fabrication methods to expand beyond architecture into the design of everyday objects.</p>

        <p>Together we’re dedicated to reducing our carbon footprint. This is done through using recycled materials, and implementing additive processes that only use the minimum amount of material needed per product. By applying our innovation-focused methods to design and fabrication, we can offer highly-customizable forms with truly unique textures while constantly exploring new ways to reduce our environmental impact.</p>
